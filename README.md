# Thesaurus esport

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: The whole project is in czech langauge. Please respect that. If you want to know what this project was about, just consult this readme. 

This is a thesaurus (https://www.dictionary.com/browse/thesaurus) of e-sport titles and their state to the end of 2019. 
It has no practical usage and it was made only as a seminary work for Knowledge organization seminary on Charles university. 

It is just a protopye of a theoretical work. If you want to use in a non-commercial way, feel free to do so, but please, follow the CC-NC-SA license.

Thank you for checking this project out and have a wondeful day.
